#wordwall
this is a relativly unknown program that my school uses.
It had rarely any cheats but you can find my gist about spoofing requests to put anything you want on the leaderboard (here)[https://gist.github.com/LynixPlayz/35ab7490d31e5707cacba3db422d3532]

Other cheats include wordwa11 reupload (which does not work for me):

and there is a hack for it on https://cheatnetwork.eu/
